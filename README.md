# Fake Job Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying **fake job postings** using Machine Learning techniques.  
With the increasing number of online job portals, fake job advertisements have become a serious issue.  
This project helps in analyzing job data and predicting whether a job post is **real or fraudulent**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- To analyze job posting data
- To understand patterns in fake vs real jobs
- To build a basic Machine Learning solution for fake job detection

---

## 🧠 Why Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is used because:
- Job data is large and complex
- Manual checking is not possible
- ML models can learn patterns from past data and predict new cases efficiently

---

## 📂 Project Phases

### 🔹 Phase 1: Problem Understanding
- Understanding fake job postings
- Identifying required features from job data

### 🔹 Phase 2: Data Collection & EDA
- Dataset collected from public sources (EMSCAD / Kaggle)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed
- Missing values handling
- Data visualization using graphs and charts

> 📄 Code for this phase is available in `eda.py`

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab
- GitHub

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Contains around **17,000+ job postings**
- Includes both **real and fake job records**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning applied

---

## 🚀 How to Run the EDA Code
1. Upload the dataset file (`DataSet.csv`)
2. Run the file `eda.py`
3. Visualizations and analysis will be displayed
